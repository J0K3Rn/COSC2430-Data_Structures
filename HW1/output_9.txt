in my:0:my dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened you my dear young lady
in my:0:but his voice was just a little too coaxing
in my:0:he overdid it
in my:0:i was keenly on my guard against him
in my:0:i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered
in my:0:but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again
in my:0:oh it is so dreadfully still in there
in my:0:only that said he looking at me keenly
in my:0:why what did you think i asked
in my:0:why do you think that i lock this door
in my:0:i am sure that i do not know
in my:0:it is to keep people out who have no business there
in my:0:do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner
in my:0:i am sure if i had known
in my:0:well then you know now
in my:0:and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demon ill throw you to the mastiff
in my:0:i was so terrified that i do not know what i did
in my:0:i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room
in my:0:i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
in my:0:then i thought of you mr holmes
in my:0:i could not live there longer without some advice
in my:0:i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child
in my:0:they were all horrible to me
in my:0:if i could only bring you down all would be well
in my:0:of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears
in my:0:my mind was soon made up
in my:0:i would send you a wire
in my:0:i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier
in my:0:a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free
in my:0:i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
in my:0:i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mr
in my:0:rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child
in my:0:now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do
in my:0:holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
in my:0:my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
in my:0:is toller still drunk he asked
in my:0:yes
in my:0:i heard his wife tell mr
in my:0:rucastle that she could do nothing with him
in my:0:that is well
in my:0:and the rucastles go out to night
in my:0:yes
in my:0:is there a cellar with a good strong lock
in my:0:yes the wine cellar
in my:0:you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter
in my:0:do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman
in my:0:i will try
in my:0:what is it
in my:0:we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i
in my:0:the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable
in my:0:there only remains mr
in my:0:toller who might give the alarm
in my:0:if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely
in my:0:i will do it
in my:0:excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair
in my:0:of course there is only one feasible explanation
in my:0:you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
in my:0:that is obvious
in my:0:as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america
in my:0:you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair
in my:0:hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also
in my:0:by a curious chance you came upon her tresses
in my:0:the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers possibly her fiance and no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions
in my:0:the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her
in my:0:so much is fairly clear
in my:0:the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
in my:0:what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated
in my:0:my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
in my:0:dont you see that the converse is equally valid
in my:0:i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children
in my:0:this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
in my:0:i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client
in my:0:a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it
in my:0:oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
in my:0:we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man
in my:0:we can do nothing until seven oclock
in my:0:at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
in my:0:we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside public house
in my:0:the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door step
in my:0:have you managed it asked holmes
in my:0:a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
in my:0:that is mr
in my:0:toller in the cellar said she
in my:0:her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
in my:0:here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles
in my:0:you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm
in my:0:now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
in my:0:we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described
in my:0:holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar
in my:0:then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success
in my:0:no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over
in my:0:i trust that we are not too late said he
in my:0:i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you
in my:0:now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
in my:0:it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength
in my:0:together we rushed into the room
in my:0:it was empty
in my:0:there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen
in my:0:the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone
in my:0:there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off
in my:0:but how
in my:0:through the skylight
in my:0:we shall soon see how he managed it
in my:0:he swung himself up onto the roof
in my:0:ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
in my:0:that is how he did it
in my:0:but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away
in my:0:he has come back and done it
in my:0:i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man
in my:0:i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair
in my:0:i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
in my:0:the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand
in my:0:miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him
in my:0:you villain said he wheres your daughter
in my:0:the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight
in my:0:it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power
in my:0:ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
in my:0:hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter
in my:0:i have my revolver said i
